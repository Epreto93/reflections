How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
Using diff helped to highlight only the sections of code that had been 
changed. This saved me from having to look through the entire document.

Having easy access to the entire history of a file helps in that you can go back to any previous version and see the differences made since then.

A con of manually choosing when to commit rather than saving automatically is human error - there is a chance you might forget. A pro is that you have th flexibility to choose when to commit and to commit at logical stages.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

it might be a waist of memmory to save a new version of a file that hasn't had any changes made to it.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows you all the commits in history for the file/document, git diff followed by two commit ids shows you detail on the changes made, eg lines added and deleted. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

By giving you a way to easily find bugs/ errors that have been introduced and revert to an earlier version that is bug free

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
